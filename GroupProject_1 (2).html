		<h3>What is Java?</h3>
		<p>Java is a write-once, run-anywhere programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It is similar to C and
			C++ but a lot easier. You can combine Java with a lot of technologies like Spring, node js, Android, Hadoop,
			J2EE, etc… to build robust, scalable, portable and distributed full-fledged applications. Java also promotes
			continuous integration and testing using tools like Selenium. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Banking:</b> To deal with transaction management.</li>
			<li><b>Retail:</b> Billing applications that you see in a store/restaurant are completely written in Java.
			</li>
			<li><b>Information Technology:</b> Java is designed to solve implementation dependencies.</li>
			<li><b>Financial services:</b>It is used in server-side applications.</li>
			<li><b>Stock market:</b>To write algorithms as to which company they should invest in. </li>
			<li><b>Big Data:</b>Hadoop MapReduce framework is written using Java. </li>
			<li><b>Scientific and Research Community: </b>To deal with huge amount of data. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Simple:</b> Java has made life easier by removing all the complexities such as pointers, operator
				overloading as you see in C++ or any other programming language.</li>
			<li><b>Portable:</b> This is platform independent which means that any application written on one platform
				can be easily ported to another platform.</li>
			<li><b>Object-oriented:</b> Everything is considered to be an “object” which possess some state, behavior
				and all the operations are performed using these objects.</li>
			<li><b>Secured:</b>All the code is converted in bytecode after compilation, which is not readable by a
				human. and java does not use an explicit pointer and run the programs inside the sandbox to prevent any
				activities from untrusted sources. It enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems/applications.
			</li>
			<li><b>Dynamic:</b> It has the ability to adapt to an evolving environment which supports dynamic memory
				allocation due to which memory wastage is reduced and performance of the application is increased. </li>
			<li><b>Distributed:</b>This language provides a feature which helps to create distributed applications.
				Using Remote Method Invocation (RMI), a program can invoke a method of another program across a network
				and get the output. You can access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre>public class HelloWorldApp {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
            }
 }
        </pre>

		<h1>Python</h1>
		<br>
		<img src="p.jpg"
			style="width: 90xp;height: 90px; position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px;">
		<h3>What is Python?</h3>
		<p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and
			first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
			significant whitespace.
			Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for
			small and large-scale projects.
			Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
			structured (particularly, procedural),
			object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language
			due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Web Development:</b> Python can be used to make web-applications at a rapid rate. Why is that? It is
				because of the frameworks
				Python uses to create these applications.</li>
			<li><b>Game Development:</b> Python is also used in the development of interactive games.
				There are libraries such as PySoy which is a 3D game engine supporting Python 3,
				PyGame which provides functionality and a library for game development.
			</li>
			<li><b>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:</b> Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are
				the talks of the town as they yield the most promising careers for the future.
				The programming language that mostly everyone chooses? It’s Python. Why? Support for these domains with
				the libraries that exist already such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy.</li>
			<li><b>Business Applications:</b>They require applications which are scalable, extensible and easily
				readable and Python provides us with all these features. Platforms such as Tryton can be used to develop
				such business applications.</li>
			<li><b>Audio and Video Applications:</b>Python can be used to develop applications that can multi-task and
				also output media.
				Video and audio applications such as TimPlayer, Cplay have been developed using Python libraries.</li>
			<li><b>CAD Applications:</b>Computer-Aided Designing is a very complicated application to make as many
				things have to be taken care of.
				Objects and their representation, functions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to something
				like this.
				Python makes this simple too and the most well-known application for CAD is Fandango. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Easy to code:</b> Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the
				language as compared to other languages like C, C#,
				Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics in
				a few hours or days.</li>
			<li><b>Object-Oriented Language:</b> One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming.
				Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc.</li>
			<li><b>GUI Programming Support:</b> Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5,
				PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in python.
				PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.</li>
			<li><b>High-Level Language:</b>Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not
				need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory. </li>
			<li><b>Extensible:</b> Python is a Extensible language. We can write us some Python code into C or C++
				language and also we can compile that code in C/C++ language. </li>
			<li><b> Portable:</b>Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have python code for
				windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not
				need to change it, we can run this code on any platform. </li>
			<li><b> Large Standard Library:</b>Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module
				and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.
				There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers,
				etc. </li>
			<li><b> Dynamically Language:</b>Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example-
				int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we
				don’t need to specify the type of variable. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre>person = ["Abdulaziz", "Sultan", "Omar"]

             for x in person:

              if x == "Sultan":

               print(x)

              else:

               print("not Sutan")
 }

	<!--Javascript-->
	<div id="content4" class="tabcontent" style="position: relative;display: none;">
		<h1>Javascript</h1>
		<img src="js.png" alt="logo"
			style="width: 90xp;height: 90px; position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px;">

		<h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
		<p> To put things simply, JavaScript is an object orient programming language designed to make web development
			easier and more attractive. In most cases, JavaScript is used to create responsive, interactive elements for
			web pages, enhancing the user experience. Things like menus, animations, video players, interactive maps,
			and even simple in-browser games can be created quickly and easily with JavaScript.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Websites:</b> lets you add behavior to the web page where the page responds to actions without
				loading a new page to request processing. .</li>
			<li><b>Web Applications:</b> As browsers and personal computers have continued to improve, JavaScript gained
				the ability to create robust web applications. Consider applications like Google Maps. .
			</li>
			<li><b>Presentations:</b> A very popular use of JavaScript is to create presentations as websites. Using the
				Reveal.js framework, this becomes really easy if you are familiar with HTML and CSS.</li>
			<li><b>Server Applications:</b>With the advent of Node.js a few years ago, JavaScript made its way from the
				browser into the server. Since then Node is adopted by major companies such as Wal-Mart, as a key part
				of back end infrastructure..</li>
			<li><b>Games:</b>While the browser hasn’t been the traditional games platform in the past, recently it has
				become robust for games. Additionally, with the addition of HTML5 canvas, the level of complexity that
				is possible in the browser-based games has increased exponentially. There are even browser games that
				teach us programming.. </li>
			<li><b>Art:</b>One of the new features of HTML5 specification is the canvas element, which allows the
				browser to render three-dimensional spaces. This helps to open the browser as a new source for digital
				art projects.. </li>
			<li><b>Mobile Apps: </b>One of the most powerful things you can do with JavaScript is to build an
				application for non-web contexts.
				That’s the other way of saying that you can make apps for things that are aren’t on the internet.. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Object-Centered Script Language:</b> Object Centered Language features built in the object as Java
				Script has a window object. Some Common Examples of Object Centered languages are Java Script and Visual
				Basic etc. The object-centered languages are mostly used for features like Polymorphism which is a
				quality of taking an object in many forms..</li>
			<li><b>Client Edge Technology:</b> The client is basically a term used for Web Browser in respective of
				User. The data on the server gets uploaded by a client which later used by a user in the rendered form,
				he user gets access to the client through a web browser for surfing and interacting through websites.
			</li>
			<li><b>Validation of User’s Input:</b> Validation of User’s Input is most commonly known as form validation,
				it allows users to interact with client through filling forms through web pages. The details in the form
				need to be correctly filled where form validation helps the client to validate the details entered by
				the user.</li>

			<li><b>Interpreter Centered:</b>Java Script is built with Interpreter Centered which allows the user to get
				the output without the use of Compiler. That means the input performed by the user gets rendered
				directly without the compiling of codes.
			</li>
			<li><b>Case Sensitive Format:</b> The codes written in Java Script are Case Sensitive which explains that
				there will be no difference in the output whether the codes are written in Upper Case or Lower Case
				Format. </li>

			<li><b>Handling Events:</b>The Java Script has the ability to control operations updated on servers. This is
				basically controlling the response on the website when the user tries to perform any operation the
				server handled by the client like clicking on links and options, interaction response over the website,
				etc.. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre><xmp><!DOCTYPE HTML>
			<html>

			<body>

			  <p>Before the script...</p>

			  <script>
				alert('Hello, world!');
			</script>

			  <p>...After the script.</p>

			</body>

			</html></xmp>

		<h1>C++</h1>
		<br>
		<img src="cc.png" alt="logo"
			style="width: 90xp;height: 90px; position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px;">
		<h3>What is C++?</h3>
		<p>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating
			large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is
			based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet. Java
			is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over
			C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Games:</b> C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural
				programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D
				games and provides multilayer networking..</li>
			<li><b>GUI Based Applications:</b> C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI based and desktop applications
				easily as it has got the required features.
			</li>
			<li><b>Database Software:</b> C++ is also used in writing database management software. The two most popular
				databases MySQL and Postgres are written in C++.</li>
			<li><b>Operating Systems:</b>The fact that C++ is a strongly typed and fast programming language makes it an
				ideal candidate for writing operating systems. In addition to this, C++ has a wide collection of
				system-level functions that also help in writing low-level programs.</li>
			<li><b>Browsers:</b>Browsers are mostly used in C++ for rendering purposes. Rendering engines need to be
				faster in execution as most people do not like to wait for the web page to be loaded. With the fast
				performance of C++, most browsers have their rendering software written in C++. </li>
			<li><b>Advanced Computation And Graphics:</b>C++ is useful in developing an application that requires
				high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that
				need high performance and speed. </li>
			<li><b>Cloud/Distributed System: </b>Cloud storage systems that are extensively used nowadays work close to
				the hardware. C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware.
				C++ also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Simple:</b> C++ provides a structured approach wherein you can break the problem into parts and
				design the solution modularly. It provides you a rich set of library functions that you can use while
				implementing the solution.</li>
			<li><b>Platform Dependent:</b>Platform dependent language means the language in which programs can be
				executed only on that operating system where it is developed & compiled. It cannot run or execute it on
				any other operating system. </li>
			<li><b>Object-oriented:</b> The main upgradation from C to C++ is object-oriented programming. It follows
				concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction. This makes development and
				maintenance easier. </li>
			<li><b>Memory Management:</b>C++ supports dynamic memory allocation. You can free the allocated memory at
				any time. Not only this C++ also provides dynamic memory management techniques.
			</li>
			<li><b>Powerful & Fast:</b> C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a
				wide variety of data types, functions & operators. </li>
			<li><b>Pointers:</b>Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. Pointer points to the
				memory location of a variable. C++ supports pointer and provides solutions to lots of problems that
				demand access to memory location. </li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre>#include <iostream>
			using namespace std;

			int main()
			{
			  cout << "Hello World";
			  return 0;
			}

		<h3>What is React?</h3>
		<p>React is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering webpages,
			making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. The product significantly changed the Facebook approach to development.
			After the library was released, it became extremely popular due to its revolutionary approach to programming user interfaces setting the
			long-going competition between React and Angular, another popular web development tool. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Instagram:</b> The Instagram team wanted to build a website, a one-page app, to let web visitors also access the social platform.
				 And ReactJS seemed the best fit for this purpose.
				The web app was optimized and appeared to be quick and comfortable for users. Now, both mobile and web Instagram apps are built with React.</li>
			<li><b>Netflix:</b> Netflix, which adopted ReactJS in 2015, is now using it together with Gibbon, a rendering layer. Back then,
				Netflix chose to React due to its one-way-ticket model of data flow and declarative approach to programming.
			</li>
			<li><b>Uber Eats:</b>The main idea behind creating the platform was to join three types of participants:
				restaurants, drivers, and clients. The hardest part that developers faced was interpreting the actual restaurant dashboard from web to mobile,
				 both Android and iOS. Going React Native was the only way. Albeit only a part of the Uber Eats mobile app is built on React Native,
				 the developers have achieved the expected results. The framework capacity helped them scale up and grow the service.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>SimpleJSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension:</b> JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
				It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.
				This makes the code easier to understand and debug, as it avoids the usage of complex JavaScript DOM structures.</li>
			<li><b>Virtual DOM:</b> React keeps a lightweight representation of the “real” DOM in the memory, and that is known as the “virtual” DOM (VDOM).
				 Manipulating real DOM is much slower than manipulating VDOM because nothing gets drawn on the screen.
				 When the state of an object changes, VDOM changes only that object in the real DOM instead of updating all of the objects.</li>
			<li><b>Performance:</b> React uses VDOM, which makes the web applications run much faster than those developed with alternate front-end frameworks.
				 React breaks a complex user interface into individual components,
				 allowing multiple users to work on each component simultaneously, thereby speeding up the development time. </li>
			<li><b>Extensions:</b>React goes beyond simple UI design and has many extensions that offer complete application architecture support.
				It provides server-side rendering, which entails rendering a normally client-side only web application on the server,
				 and then sends a fully rendered page to the client. It also employs Flux and Redux extensively in web application development.
				  Finally, there is React Native, a popular framework derived from React, used to create cross-compatible mobile applications.
			</li>
			<li><b>One-way Data Binding:</b> React’s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional
				 data flow means that when a developer designs a React app, they often nest child components within parent components.
				  This way, a developer knows where and when an error occurs,
				 giving them better control of the whole web application. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre>class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  			render() {
    			return (
      				< div>
        					Hello {this.props.name}
      				 < /div>
    							);
  							}
						}

								ReactDOM.render(
  									< HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  											document.getElementById('hello-example')
												);

		<h3>What is Nodejs?</h3>
		<p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.
			Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient,
			perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Applications</h3>
		<p>Some of the applications are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Paypal:</b> Paypal is one of the largest and most well-known worldwide systems for Internet payments.
				The platform enables its users to transact with each other online quickly and easily in more than 100 currencies.</li>
			<li><b>LinkedIn:</b> LinkedIn is a business-oriented social networking service found in 2002 in Mountain View,
				 California. LinkedIn allows users to invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection.
				 It is available in 24 languages and already has more than 706 million members in over 200 countries and territories.
 			 LinkedIn uses Node.js to empower the server side of its mobile app.
			</li>
			<li><b>Mozilla:</b>Mozilla is a non-profit organization, mostly well-known for it’s free, open-source web browser (Firefox) available for Windows,
				OS X, Linux, Android, and Firefox OS, in +90 languages. As of June 2020,
				Firefox has approximately 8.5% of worldwide usage as a browser, making it the second most popular web browser.
Mozilla uses Node.js as a primary language in many of their web projects. One of them is the Mozilla Persona, a cross-platform sign-in technology.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Asynchronous and Event Driven:</b> JAll APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking.
				It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and
				a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.</li>
			<li><b>Very Fast:</b> Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.</li>
			<li><b>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable:</b> Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps
				the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
				 Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server. </li>
			<li><b>No Buffering:</b>Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h3>Syntax example:</h3>
		<pre>const http = require('http');

					const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
					const port = 3000;

				const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  			res.statusCode = 200;
  			res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  			res.end('Hello World');
				});

				server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  			console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
				});
        </pre>
